    "### Possible Questions with Answers\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **What is the purpose of normalizing the images (`x_train` and `x_test`) by dividing by 255.0?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: Normalizing the pixel values to a range of [0, 1] helps speed up the training process and improves model convergence. \n",
    "   Without normalization, the large pixel values (from 0 to 255) could hinder the gradient descent optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Why do we use one-hot encoding for the labels?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: One-hot encoding transforms categorical labels into a binary matrix, \n",
    "   which is suitable for training multi-class classification models. It allows the model to treat\n",
    "   each class as a distinct entity and enables the softmax output function to work effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What is the significance of the `softmax` activation function in the output layer?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The `softmax` function converts raw output scores (logits) into probabilities that sum to 1. \n",
    "   This is essential for multi-class classification problems, where the output represents the probability of each class.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **What is the purpose of using the Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) optimizer?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: SGD is used for updating the model weights during training. \n",
    "   It updates the weights iteratively after processing each batch of data.\n",
    "   Although it is slower than some other optimizers, it is computationally efficient and commonly used for large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Explain the role of the `Dense` layers in the model.**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: `Dense` layers are fully connected layers,\n",
    "   meaning each neuron is connected to every neuron in the previous layer. These layers allow the model to learn complex \n",
    "   relationships between input features and output classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **What is the significance of the loss function `categorical_crossentropy`?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: `categorical_crossentropy` is the appropriate loss function for multi-class classification problems\n",
    "   , where each instance belongs to exactly one class. It measures the difference between the predicted probability \n",
    "   distribution and the true distribution (one-hot encoded labels).\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Why are we using `plt.imshow()` to display the test images?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: `plt.imshow()` is used to visualize the image in the test dataset to help confirm the model’s \n",
    "   predictions by comparing the predicted label to the actual image.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **What does `model.evaluate()` do?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: `model.evaluate()` computes the loss and accuracy of the model on a given dataset (in this case, the test data). It helps to assess the model's performance after training.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **What is the role of the activation function 'relu' in the hidden layers?**\n",
    "   - **Answer**: The `relu` (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function introduces non-linearity to the model,\n",
    "   enabling it to learn complex patterns in the data. It is computationally efficient and widely used in hidden layers.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. **What is the significance of `np\n",
    "\n",
    ".argmax()` in the final prediction comparison?**\n",
    "    - **Answer**: `np.argmax()` returns the index of the maximum value in an array, which corresponds to the predicted class\n",
    "    with the highest probability. It is used to determine the final predicted class for a sample.\n",
